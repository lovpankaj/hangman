## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Setup Firebase Emulator

First, install Firebase CLI globally (if not already):
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Initialize Firebase emulator:
```bash
firebase init emulators
```

### 3. Start Development Server

**Terminal 1 - Start Firebase Emulators:**
```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

This will start:
- Auth Emulator on `localhost:9099`
- Database Emulator on `localhost:9000`
- Emulator UI on `localhost:4000`

**Terminal 2 - Start React App:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Testing the App

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Sign up with any email (doesn't have to be real)
3. Select difficulty level and play!
4. View your results in the Results page
5. Check Firebase Emulator UI at `http://localhost:4000` to see stored data

## Database Structure

```
â””â”€â”€ users/
    â””â”€â”€ [UID]/
        â””â”€â”€ Scores/
            â”œâ”€â”€ [score1]
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ word: "JAVASCRIPT"
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ outcome: "won"
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ timeTaken: 120
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ difficulty: "medium"
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dateTime: "2025-10-29T..."
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ timestamp: 1698557400000
            â””â”€â”€ [score2]
                â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Game Rules

1. Guess letters one by one
2. You have 6 wrong guesses before game over
3. Guess the word before running out of attempts
4. Your score is saved with time taken

## Difficulty Levels (Based on Word Rarity in India)

- **Easy (Time Pass)**: Common words used daily by Indian teens
- **Medium (Nerve Breaking)**: Less common words from academics and media
- **Hard (Hardcore)**: Rare/technical words that test vocabulary limits

## Customization

### Adding More Words
Edit `src/wordList.js` and add words to the corresponding difficulty arrays.

### Changing Colors
Edit `src/index.css` to customize the purple gradient and other colors.

### Changing Difficulty Labels
Edit `DIFFICULTIES` object in `src/wordList.js`.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Then deploy the `dist/` folder to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Styling**: CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid
- **Testing**: Firebase Emulators

## Notes

- Email verification is not required for testing
- All data is stored per user (UID-based)
- Results are automatically sorted by latest first
- Emulator data persists if you use `--export-on-exit` flag

## Troubleshooting

**Emulator won't start?**
- Make sure ports 9000, 9099, and 4000 are not in use
- Install Java for Firebase emulators to work

**Data not saving?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in
- Check Emulator UI to see actual database state

**Game not loading words?**
- Make sure `wordList.js` is properly imported
- Check browser console for errors

Happy Gaming! ðŸŽ®
